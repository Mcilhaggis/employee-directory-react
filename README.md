## Project Description 
For this assignment, I created a employee directory with React. It required a break up of the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

When this application is launched, the home page automatically performs an API call and renders a list of 20 users within a Bootstrap table. Users are then able to filter by first name. Users are then able to sort alphabetically by both ascending and descending order for Name, Phone, Email and DOB.
## Installation 

This application is easy to install, just clone the repository and run the following command in your terminal.

`npm install`
This will create the node modules folder you will need in order for this application to function correctly.

## Usage
In order to get this application to run you must open up the terminal and enter the following:

`npm start`
The application will then console log the URL in the terminal and React automatically opens the app in your default browser.
