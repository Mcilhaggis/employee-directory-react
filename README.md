## Project Description 
For this assignment, I created a employee directory with React. It required a break up of the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

<<<<<<< HEAD
When this application is launched, the home page automatically performs an API call and renders a list of 20 users within a Bootstrap table. Users are then able to filter by first name. Users are then able to sort alphabetically by both ascending and descending order for Name, Phone, Email and DOB.
## Installation 

This application is easy to install, just clone the repository and run the following command in your terminal.

`npm install`
This will create the node modules folder you will need in order for this application to function correctly.

## Usage
In order to get this application to run you must open up the terminal and enter the following:

`npm start`
The application will then console log the URL in the terminal and React automatically opens the app in your default browser.
